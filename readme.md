# Computer Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal Computer Vision playground! This repository is a growing collection of my implementations, experiments, and full-fledged projects in the field of Computer Vision — ranging from basic image processing to deep learning-based applications.

> This repository is continuously updated as I learn and build new projects.

## Overview

This repository contains all of my hands-on work in Computer Vision, including:

- Image processing techniques using OpenCV
- Deep learning models for vision tasks (CNNs, object detection, segmentation)
- Real-time applications (gesture control, face detection, pose estimation)

I’m using this space as both a **learning diary** and a **project showcase**.

| Project                               | Description                                                                                                      | Status      |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Gesture Volume Control**            | Control system volume using hand gestures and finger distance.                                                   | Completed   |
| **Virtual Mouse**                     | A virtual mouse that can be controlled using hand movements and small gestures.                                  | Completed   |
| **Gesture Based Calculator**          | A calculator application that detects hand gestures and converts them into mathematical operations in real time. | In Progress |
| **Real-time Sign Language Detection** | A real-time application with UI that detects ASL hand gestures and converts them into words and sentences.       | In Progress |
