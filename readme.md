# 🧠 Computer Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal Computer Vision playground! This repository is a growing collection of my implementations, experiments, and full-fledged projects in the field of Computer Vision — ranging from basic image processing to deep learning-based applications.

> 🚧 This repo is continuously updated as I learn, build, and break things in the CV universe.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains all of my hands-on work in Computer Vision, including:

- 📸 Image processing techniques (OpenCV, skimage)
- 🧠 Deep learning models for vision tasks (CNNs, object detection, segmentation)
- 👁️ Real-time applications (gesture control, face detection, pose estimation)
- 📦 Tools & utilities (preprocessors, annotators, pipelines)

I’m using this space as both a **learning diary** and a **project showcase**.
